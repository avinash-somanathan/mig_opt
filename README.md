MIG Graph optimization 

To run Algebraic optimizations, all stored under the file wrapper.py

'python wrapper.py filename'

currently 3 files have been provided for testing the functionality

networkOut.out
networkTest.out
networkTest2.out

The output are 2 graphs first one representing original network and second one representing optimized network.
The tab name should reveal which one is original and which one is optimized.
These also get stored as .pdf files in your local machine

To test other circuits you will have to write a simple function and Add it to ABC package
